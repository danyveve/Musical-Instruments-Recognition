# Musical-Instruments-Recognition
This project uses a Random Forrest algorithm to clasify musical instruments based on their sound features. It was designed for the Intelligent Systems Realization Techniques course of my BA programme at UBB.

The project is implemented using the guidelines and dataset provided at this link: https://medium.com/@nadimkawwa/can-we-guess-musical-instruments-with-machine-learning-afc8790590b8.
